# Quantum Module Project

This project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose in the design and development of the quantum module. Below is a brief description of each directory:

- **Schematics**: Contains all schematic files (.sch) for the quantum module. If there are multiple schematic files for different parts of the module, they are further subdivided.

- **PCB Designs**: Stores all PCB layout files (.kicad_pcb). If the project involves multiple PCB designs, they are organized into subfolders.

- **Components**: This directory is divided into two subdirectories:
  - **Custom Components**: Stores custom component libraries (.lib) and footprint files (.pretty) for quantum-specific parts.
  - **Standard Components**: Contains files for standard components with modifications.

- **Simulation**: Contains files related to simulation, including scripts or output data. These might not be directly related to KiCAD but are crucial for the overall project.

- **Documentation**: Includes all documentation files such as datasheets, design specifications, and manuals. It is further divided into 'Datasheets', 'Design Specs', and 'Manuals' subfolders for better organization.

- **Firmware**: If the module includes microcontrollers or other programmable devices, the source code and binaries are stored here.

- **Testing and Validation**: Contains test procedures, test results, and validation reports for the quantum module.

- **Production**: Includes files related to the manufacturing process, such as Gerber files, assembly drawings, and BOMs (Bills of Materials).

- **Resources**: A general folder for additional resources like reference materials, design guides, or third-party tools.

- **Archives**: For older versions of files or backup purposes.

Each folder is properly named and organized to ensure that anyone working on or reviewing the project can easily understand and locate the necessary files.
